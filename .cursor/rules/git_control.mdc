description: Complete user control over Git commands - AI never executes git commands, but can execute any other command without asking
globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true

- **General Command Permission:**
  - **✅ CAN execute** any system command without asking
  - **✅ CAN execute** npm, yarn, pnpm, docker, etc without confirmation
  - **✅ CAN execute** scripts, tests, linters, formatters without asking
  - **✅ DON'T need to ask** before executing simple or common commands
  - **❌ ONLY EXCEPTION**: `git` commands that modify the repository

- **Read Commands - Automatic Execution:**
  - **✅ ALWAYS execute without asking** commands that only read information:
    - `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more` - File viewing
    - `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `tree` - Search and listing
    - `wc`, `stat`, `file` - File information
    - `read_file` (tool) - File reading
    - Any command that **does not modify** files or system
  - **✅ NEVER ask** before executing read commands
  - **✅ Execute immediately** without waiting for user confirmation

- **Absolute Prohibition of Executing Git Commands:**
  - **❌ NEVER execute** `git` commands automatically
  - **❌ NEVER do** `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git merge`, etc
  - **❌ NEVER modify** git repository state
  - **✅ ONLY suggest** git commands when appropriate
  - **✅ ONLY read** git information (git status, git diff, git log) for analysis

- **Allowed Git Commands (Read Only):**
  - ✅ `git status` - To check repository state
  - ✅ `git diff` - To analyze changes
  - ✅ `git log` - To view history
  - ✅ `git show` - To view commit details
  - ✅ `git branch` - To list branches (without creating/modifying)
  - ✅ Any git command that **only reads** information

- **Prohibited Git Commands (Never Execute):**
  - ❌ `git add` - User adds files
  - ❌ `git commit` - User makes commits
  - ❌ `git push` - User pushes
  - ❌ `git pull` - User pulls
  - ❌ `git merge` - User merges
  - ❌ `git checkout` - User switches branches
  - ❌ `git branch -d` or `-D` - User deletes branches
  - ❌ `git reset` - User resets
  - ❌ `git rebase` - User rebases
  - ❌ `git tag` - User creates tags
  - ❌ Any command that **modifies** the repository

- **When to Suggest Git Commands:**
  - ✅ After task/subtask completion - suggest commit message
  - ✅ When there are uncommitted changes - suggest commit
  - ✅ When there are conflicts - suggest resolution (but don't execute)
  - ✅ When update is needed - suggest pull (but don't execute)
  - ✅ Always present as **suggestion**, never execute

- **Suggestion Format:**
  ```markdown
  ✅ Task completed!

  📝 Commit suggestion (you execute):
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat(module): Description"
  ```
  ```

  **NEVER do:**
  ```bash
  # ❌ DON'T: Execute automatically
  git add .
  git commit -m "..."
  ```

- **Exceptions and Special Cases:**
  - **NO EXCEPTION for git**: This rule is absolute for git commands
  - **For non-git commands**: Execute directly without asking
  - **For git commands**: Even if user explicitly asks, **always suggest** instead of executing
  - If in doubt about whether a command is git or not, check if it starts with `git` before executing

- **Integration with Other Rules:**
  - [commit_practices.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commit_practices.mdc) - Suggest commits, never execute
  - RBIN Task Flow workflow should not include automatic git execution

- **Fundamental Principle:**
  > **User has complete control over the Git repository. AI can execute any system command without asking, EXCEPT git commands. For git, only suggests, analyzes, and informs. Never modifies git state.**
