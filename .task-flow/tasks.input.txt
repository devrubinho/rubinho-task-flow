# RBIN Task Flow - Task Definitions

## How to use this file:

1. Write your tasks below in natural language
2. Use the format: `- Task description` (no [ ] needed)
3. Use `task-flow: sync` to generate subtasks from your tasks
4. Use `task-flow: status` to view task progress

## Contexts:

- The `.task-flow/contexts/` folder is for AIs to consult when working on tasks (different file types: .md, .txt, .png, .jpg, .json, etc.)
- Add specs, mockups, requirements, examples, or any reference file to this folder
- RBIN Task Flow detects and references them when generating and implementing subtasks
- To reference a specific context in a task: `task-flow-screen filename.ext`
- Example: `- Create login screen task-flow-screen login-mockup.png`

## Tasks:

- First task
- Second task
