# Example Context

This folder (`.task-flow/contexts/`) is for AIs to consult reference material when working on tasks.

## Purpose

- **Contexts** = any files that help the AI understand what to build or how to do it
- The AI reads and uses these files when generating subtasks and when implementing them
- Different file types are supported: images, docs, specs, examples, etc.

## Supported file types (examples)

- **Images:** `.png`, `.jpg` – mockups, screenshots, diagrams
- **Text / docs:** `.md`, `.txt` – specs, requirements, notes
- **Data / config:** `.json`, `.yaml` – examples, schema, sample data
- **Other:** any file that is useful as context for the task

## How to use

1. Add your context files to this folder with descriptive names (e.g. kebab-case)
2. RBIN Task Flow lists and references them when generating subtasks
3. To reference a specific file in a task, use: `task-flow-screen filename.ext`

## Example names

- `login-mockup.png`
- `api-contract.json`
- `requirements.md`
- `dashboard-spec.txt`
